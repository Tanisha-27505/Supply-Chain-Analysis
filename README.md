Generated Insights to Solve a Supply Chain Issue in the FMCG domain

Introduction:

The expanding FMCG company AtliQ Mart has its headquarters located in Gujarat, India. Surat, Ahmedabad, and Vadodara are the three cities where it is now in operation. Within the next two years, they hope to grow into more Tier 1 cities and metropolises.

A few important clients of AtliQ Mart did not renew their yearly contracts at this time because of problems with service. There are rumours that some of the necessary products were either partially or not delivered at all over an extended period, which may have led to subpar customer service. The management has asked their supply chain analytics team to monitor the "On time" and "In full" delivery service level for every customer daily to address this problem before expanding to additional cities.

Results:

Every Key Metric (OT%, IF%, OTIF%) is far below the desired level.
Orders are typically delayed by 0.42 days from the scheduled delivery date.
The stores with the most orders, Lotus Mart, Coolblue, and Acclaimed, also have the longest delivery delays.

Is it a result of our inaccurate delivery date estimations?
Is it because there are more orders than we anticipated?
The items that arrive later are butter, curd, and ghee.
Over the past few months, there have been no appreciable improvements in any of the important measures.
For the majority of the clients, the IF% has a significant disparity. Is there reduced production as a result?
